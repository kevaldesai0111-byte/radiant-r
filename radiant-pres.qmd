## Introduction

-   Radiant is a free, web-based platform for business analytics
-   Works on R but requires no coding
-   Provides a point-and-click interface similar to Excel
-   Generates R code automatically—learn while you work
-   Key applications: Market segmentation, Customer analytics, Predictive modeling, A/B testing

## Shiny & Radiant

*Shiny:* Open-source R package for creating interactive web apps. Transforms R analyses into interactive dashboards.

*Radiant:* Web-based business analytics platform built on R. Provides an intuitive GUI for statistical analysis. Acts as a bridge: R's power ↔ Point-and-click interface.

Example analogy: "Menu-driven restaurant – pick from menu, R does the cooking"

## Key Features & Modules

*Data Section:* Import/Export data (Excel, CSV), Manage datasets, Transform variables & filter/combine datasets

*Model Section:* Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

*Basics Section:* Cross-tabs, Correlation, Compare Means, Single Mean Test

*Specialized Tools:* Design experiments, Factor/Cluster Analysis, Maps

## R Code to Install and Launch

-   options(repos = c( RSM = "[https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran",](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/minicran%22,) CRAN = "[https://cloud.r-project.org"](https://cloud.r-project.org%22) ))

-   install.packages("radiant")

-   library(radiant)

-   radiant::radiant()

## Live Demo

## Advantages

-   User-friendly for beginners, no coding required
-   Teaches R through code generation
-   Reproducible analysis: one-click replication
-   Comprehensive business tools in one menu
-   Active development with new features

## Limitations

-   Limited customization vs pure R coding
-   Learning curve for interface & statistical terms
-   Can be slow with very large datasets
-   Requires R installation
-   Less flexibility than writing custom code

## Practical Exercise

*Task for Next Class:*

1.  Install and launch Radiant on your computer
2.  Load the built-in "diamonds" dataset
3.  Create a visualization showing the relationship between carat and price
4.  Run a simple linear regression with price as dependent variable and carat as independent variable
5.  Export the R code generated by Radiant
