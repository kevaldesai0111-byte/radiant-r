  Radiant is a free tool that helps people analyze business data without needing to know computer programming. It works through a web browser and runs on R, which is a popular software for statistics and data analysis. The main advantage of Radiant is that users can simply click buttons and menus to do their analysis, similar to using Excel, but it also creates the actual programming code automatically in the background. This means beginners can learn how real coding works while doing practical work with their data. Radiant has different sections for different tasks - one section helps upload and organize data, another runs basic statistics like averages and correlations, and another builds prediction models to forecast things like sales or customer behavior. The tool is particularly useful for business tasks such as understanding different customer groups, analyzing customer patterns, and predicting outcomes. Most demonstrations use a practice dataset about diamond prices to show how the tool works for exploring data and running analysis. While Radiant makes data analysis much easier for beginners and teaches programming skills along the way, it does have some drawbacks - it offers less control than writing code directly and can be slow with very large amounts of data. Overall, Radiant serves as a helpful stepping stone between simple spreadsheet tools and advanced programming, making professional data analysis accessible to people who are just starting out.

# Introduction

## What Is Shiny?

Shiny is an open-source R package that provides a framework for creating **interactive web applications** directly from R code. It allows users to manipulate data, run analyses, and view results dynamically in a browser.

## What Is Radiant?

"Radiant is a web-based, open-source platform for business analytics and data science. It's built on the R programming language but is designed to be used through a **point-and-click interface,** making powerful statistical analysis accessible to people who may not know how to code."

### A simple analogy

Radiant is like a **menu-driven restaurant**:

-   You choose items (analysis options)
-   Radiant (the kitchen) cooks them using R
-   You get the results without writing code\
